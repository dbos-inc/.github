DBOS provides lightweight, durable, Postgres-backed workflows.
DBOS workflows replace queues, state management, and failure-handling/recovery logic to enable you to build reliable programs in a fraction of the code.

To get started, follow the [quickstart](https://docs.dbos.dev/quickstart) to install the open-source library and connect it to a Postgres database.
Then, annotate workflows and steps in your program to make it durable!
That's all you need to do&mdash;there's no additional infrastructure for you to configure or manage.
